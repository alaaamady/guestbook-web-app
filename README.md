## Front - End
### For the client side I used: 

 1. react
 2. react-router
 3. axios: for sending requests to the server
 

### In the `guestbook-web-app`You'll find:

 - `components` directory containing all components
 - `hooks` directory containing all hooks
 - `index.js` root file
 - `App.js` first component

### Make sure to: 
 - run `npm install` to include all dependencies
 - run your app with with 	`npm start`	


### Some of the practices I followed:

 - Single Responsibility Principle: writing functions with descriptive names that have one sole purpose
 - I have not included any comments in my code because "A comment is a failure to express yourself in code" -Robert Martin
 - all variables and constants have descriptive names, no `x`, `y` or `var1` naming
 - used `const` instead of `let` almost always, I believe that if I find myself needing to use a variable I ask myself "is there a better way to do this?"

### What to Improve: 

 1. add styling to the app
 2. add comments component
 3. add testing
